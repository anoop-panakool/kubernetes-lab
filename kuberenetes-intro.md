## Kubernetes Cluster Setup

1. Using kubeadm to bootstrap On-Premise Cluster
2. Using Docker Desktop for Windows (Single Node cluster)
3. For Windows 7/8 or Mac OS : Minikube (Single Node cluster)
4. Kubernetes on cloud (PaaS) AKS, EKS, GKE


Production like ENV : OnPremise using kubeadm 
                      Managed Kuberenets (PaaS) from Cloud Vendors

Kubernetes deployment architectures

- POD           Single atomic Unit for deployment, Contains one or more containers & volumes
- ReplicaSet    Enable Self Healing and Scaling for PODS
- Deployment    To enable RollingUpdate and history of deployments
- Service       To create an ENDPOINT for accessing POD
- volumes       A Directory/Folder mounted inside the container
- ConfigMap     A Set of KEY VALUE pairs injected inside the POD as ENV Vars
- Secrets       Generic secrets : Basic Key Value pair where Value is encrypted with
            Base64
            TLS : Signed Certificates
            docker-registry
- Job           Background (Long running) application
- CronJob       Scheduled Jobs
- StatefulSet   Alternative to both ReplicaSet and Deployment
            - Pods are created and destroyed in Fixed order
            - Pod IPs are STATIC
            - Used for Attaching Sessions to selected pod only (Sticky Session)
- VolumeClass   - External Volume plugin (Connect with NFS, Azure Blob or Azure File Share)
- PersistentVolume    Volume created and stored Outside kuberenetes cluster.
- PersistentVolumeClaim     A Pod claims a part of persistentVolume
