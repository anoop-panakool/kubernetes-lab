If you want to try out the examples here yourself, here are a couple of options:

## OpenShift Playground
You can use the OpenShift Playground to get access to a cluster for 60 minutes at a time. This option doesn't require you to install anything. This is the option we used for most of the examples on the site.

[OpenShift Playground](https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift42)

Click the red *START SCENARIO* button, and then you will have access to an OpenShift cluster via a web-based terminal window with `kubectl` available.



## Minikube
Another option is to install Minikube, which runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your laptop.

## Other options
Alternatively, you can head over to [try.openshift.com](https://try.openshift.com) for other ways to access or install an OpenShift cluster.
