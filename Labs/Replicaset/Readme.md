# ReplicaSets

#### Most applications should be scalable and all must be fault tolerant. Pods do not provide those features, ReplicaSets do.

## Prerequisites

- Cluster should be in Ready state

## Instructions

Letâ€™s take a look at a `ReplicaSet` based on the Pod defination file [go-demo-2.yml](/Labs/Replicaset/go-demo-2.yml)

![go-demo-2.yml](https://github.com/shivamjhalabfiles/kubernetes-lab/blob/master/images/go-demo-2.png)

> #### Note : The `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields are mandatory with all Kubernetes objects. `ReplicaSet` is no exception, i.e., it is also a Kubernetes object.

### Create the ReplicaSet 
```
kubectl create -f go-demo-2.yml
```
> We got the response that the replicaset "go-demo-2" was created.

Confirm that by listing all the ReplicaSets in the cluster.
```bash
kubectl get rs
```
> The **output** is as follows.

```bash
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
go-demo-2   2         2         0       12s
```
Instead of retrieving all the replicas in the cluster, we can retrieve those specified in defination file `go-demo-2.yml`

```bash
kubectl get -f go-demo-2.yml
```

Describle the `Replicaset` with kubectl describe command.
```
kubectl describe -f go-demo-2.ym
```
> The **output** is as follows.
```yaml

```
> We can see that ReplicaSet created two Pods while trying to match the desired state with the actual state.

 If you want to sure that ReplicaSet created the Pods, run below command in the cluster and confirm
 ```
 kubectl get pods --show-labels
 ```
> The **output** is as follows.
```
root@master:~/# kubectl get pods --show-labels

## **Sequential breakdown of the Process followed to create the ReplicaSet**

The sequence of events that happens when you run `kubectl create -f go-demo-2.yml` command is as follows.

1. Kubernetes client (kubectl) sent a request to the API server requesting the creation of a ReplicaSet defined in the `go-demo-2.yml` file.

2. The controller is watching the API server for new events, and it detected that there is a new ReplicaSet object.

3. The controller creates two new pod definitions because we have configured replica value as 2 in go-demo-2.yml file.

4. Since the scheduler is watching the API server for new events,it detected that there are two unassigned Pods.

5. The scheduler decided which node to assign the Pod and sent that information to the API server.

6. Kubelet is also watching the API server.It detected that the two Pods are assigned to the node it is running on.

7. Kubelet sent requests to Docker requesting the creation of the containers that form the Pod. In our case, the Pod defines two containers based on the mongo and api image. So in total four containers are created.

8. Finally, Kubelet sent a request to the API server notifying it that the Pods were created successfully.

### The sequence described above says what happened in the cluster from the moment we requested the creation of a new ReplicaSet. 
### **We will see the same process through a diagram that more closely represents the cluster.**
